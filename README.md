# Real-time Hand Detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV

## Project Overview

This project utilizes the MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries to perform real-time hand detection using a webcam. By processing video frames captured from the camera, the program detects and tracks the landmarks of the user's hand, providing valuable data for various applications such as gesture recognition, sign language translation, and virtual touch interfaces.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`) library
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`) library

## Installation

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## Usage

1. Connect a webcam to your computer.
2. Run the Python script `hand_detection.py`.
3. Position your hand in front of the webcam.
4. The program will detect and visualize the landmarks of your hand in real-time.
5. Experiment with different hand gestures and movements to observe the tracking accuracy.

## Components

### Libraries Used
- **OpenCV (`cv2`)**: Used for accessing the webcam and processing video frames.
- **MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)**: Provides pre-trained models and algorithms for hand detection and landmark tracking.

### Algorithm
- The program captures video frames from the webcam using OpenCV.
- It processes each frame to detect and track the landmarks of the hand using the MediaPipe library.
- Detected landmarks are visualized on the video frame using OpenCV drawing functions.
- The program calculates and displays the frames per second (FPS) rate to monitor performance.

## Example Applications

- **Gesture Recognition**: Recognize and interpret hand gestures for controlling applications or games.
- **Sign Language Translation**: Translate sign language gestures into text or spoken language.
- **Virtual Touch Interfaces**: Create virtual touchscreens or interfaces controlled by hand movements.

## Notes

- Ensure proper lighting and hand positioning for accurate detection and tracking.
- Experiment with different camera angles and distances for optimal performance.
- Performance may vary depending on hardware capabilities and environmental factors.
